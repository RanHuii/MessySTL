# MessySTL
## Introduction
This is my own version of STL called MessySTL. The purpose of this project is to understand the advantage parts of C++(runtime optimazxation and memory allcoation)
The containers in the libary uses a self-defined allocator which uses a memory pool to manage memory.
The library uses type traits and move operation to optimize the speed.
Containers use allocator to obtain memory. Algorithms access to containers' members through iterator. 

## To run this project,
* Clone the project to a local directory (git clone https://github.com/RanHuii/MessySTL.git)
* Open and run the project with Visual Studio
