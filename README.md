# MessySTL

This is my own version of STL called MessySTL. The purpose of this project is to get deep understand on C++ low-level programming and metaprogramming.
The STL has six components - containers, algorithms, iterators, allocators, functors and adapters.
Containers use allocator to obtain memory. Algorithms access to containers' members through iterator.
